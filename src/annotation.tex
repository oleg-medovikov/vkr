This work is a report on the work done on the design and creation of a delta robot.

Objectives of work:

Analysis of the mathematical solution of the direct and inverse problems of controlling a delta robot.

Creating a digital copy of the future robot with the ability to change parameters, such as the radius of the base, the length of the levers and the length of the articulated joints. Build a valid model based on printed parts.

Write a sketch for Arduino that implements control of stepper motors and communication with a computer via a com-port.

Write a delta robot control program capable of arbitrarily changing the coordinate of the robot carriage.

The result of the work is a robot model, analysis of structural defects, plans for subsequent modernization of the structure.
